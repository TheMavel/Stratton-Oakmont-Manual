        <h2>Real Estate Investors</h2>
        
        <p>"Great investment, but you don't have the liquidity or the diversification of the market? In this type of (investment/economic environment) you shouldn't make a move without that."</p>
        
        <p>When speaking with real estate investors, emphasize that while real estate provides solid returns, it lacks the following benefits that securities offer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Immediate liquidity for opportunities or emergencies</li>
            <li>Ease of diversification across industries and markets</li>
            <li>Lower transaction costs compared to real estate sales</li>
            <li>No maintenance or property management concerns</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Ask them about their experience with real estate investments, then explain how our offerings can complement their existing portfolio strategy by providing balance through diversification.</p>

        <h2>Corporate Finance Opportunities</h2>
        
        <p>The individuals you are calling are the top executives at that company and possibly many others. Many times not only are they excellent retail clientele for Stratton Oakmont, but they also may be good candidates for a Corporate Finance relationship.</p>
        
        <p>If a prospect says they're interested in raising money for their company or an Investment Banking relationship, simply ask them to send us a Business Plan and mention that audited financials would help.</p>

        </address>
        
        <p>When speaking with corporate executives, be alert for these indicators of potential corporate finance opportunities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mention of growth plans requiring capital</li>
            <li>Dissatisfaction with current banking relationships</li>
            <li>Interest in going public or acquiring other companies</li>
