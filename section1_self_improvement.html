        <h2>Napoleon Hill's Principles</h2>
        
        <h3>Personal Experience</h3>
        <p>I first heard about Napoleon Hill's principles of personal achievement when I was working my way through college selling life insurance during the 1960s.</p>
        <p>One day I called on a man who sold reference books door to door. He bought a policy from me but said that my pitch could use a little work. He gave me a copy of Hill's Think and Grow Rich, which had been written in 1937.</p>
        <p>I read the book and almost immediately noticed that my attitude was better... and that my sales pitch had started to improve.</p>
        <p>I was curious about how Hill, the father of the self-improvement movement, had come to write this classic, whose message is still valid today.</p>
        
        <h3>Rising to Carnegie's Challenge</h3>
        <p>In 1908, when Hill was a 25-year-old journalist, he was assigned to write a profile of steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. During their meeting, Carnegie talked about how he had become a success.</p>
        <p>At the end of the interview, the wealthy industrialist challenged Hill to develop a practical personal philosophy that could be used by anyone in any field to achieve his/her goals.</p>
        <p>Hill accepted the challenge. Although Carnegie did not fund the project, he provided Hill with introductions to business and political leaders and innovative thinkers of the day, including Henry Ford, William Howard Taft and Thomas Edison.</p>
        <p>Hill labored for nearly 30 years researching, writing and refining the book that summarized his findings. It continues to be read by millions of people around the world today.</p>
        
        <h3>Hill's Principles of Success</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Develop definiteness of purpose.</strong> Hill believed that the path to success begins with a plan for your life. Simply stating that you want to become rich or successful, however, is not the same as setting a specific, achievable goal.</p>
                <p>Hill called this major goal the definite major purpose. He suggested that readers write down their major purpose and study it. Doing this makes the purpose's inherent strengths and weaknesses obvious.</p>
                <p>Next: Create a plan for capitalizing on the strengths and shoring up weak points.</p>
                <p>Read your plan every day. Having your definite major purpose in sharp focus on a daily basis will help you make choices that advance your plan, rather than distract you from it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Establish a "mastermind alliance"</strong> - that is two or more people working in the spirit of perfect harmony toward a common objective.</p>
                <p>Such an alliance is basically a relationship in which your strengths are complemented by someone else's, and you've both made a long-term commitment to work toward a major objective.</p>
                <p>You can establish your own mastermind alliance in the workplace by developing a relationship with a mentor. You might approach this person by saying something like...</p>
                <p><em>I really admire the way you do things. You're successful at what you do, and I think you're an exceptional role model. I would like to spend some time with you and have the benefit of your experience. Would you mind helping me?</em></p>
                <p>Generally people are flattered when you put your request in a positive context. Eventually, you can even offer to help your chosen mentor work toward shared objectives.</p>
                <p>Important: Choose someone who has the ability to do the job and who can work in harmony with you. Look for someone who seems to enjoying helping others...someone who can help you now or might be able to help in some way sometime in the future.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Develop a positive mental attitude.</strong> If you don't believe that something is possible, you will never really succeed at it. And if you think you will fail, you probably will.</p>
                <p>You may not be successful on your first try even with a positive attitude. But if you perservere, eventually you will prevail. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy-you have to have the faith that a goal can be achieved, and that it can be achieved by you.</p>
                <p>Strategy: Eliminate negative thoughts as soon as they occur, and replace them with positive thoughts. When you have moments of self-doubt and negativism, stop for a moment and recall the successes you have achieved in the past and how those experiences could be applied to the current situation. Associate with positive people.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Enforce self-discipline:</strong> Success is rooted in developing strong character - the discipline of mind and body, and the management of money and time.</p>
                <p>Key: Get into the habit of doing the most important work first. Remember, all success comes at a price. You have to accept the trade-off and decide at the beginning whether the goal is worthy of the effort that is required.</p>
                <p>Discipline is learned in a similar fashion. Every bad habit is developed by repeating a certain behavior until it becomes a part of the way you do things. Good habits are developed by sub-situting desirable behaviors for undesirable ones. Start small. Allow extra time to practice so that you are always on time for meetings.</p>
                <p>Make it your practice to always do what you say you will when you have promised to do it.</p>
                <p>Tell the truth. If you have a habit of putting things off, vow to stop procrastinating. Then do it. Force yourself to take action now, instead of later.</p>
                <p>When you see someone in your field win a major achievement award, realize that the moment is often the end of a long hard itinerary. What you're not seeing is the time during which the individual enforced rigorous personal discipline to achieve this prize.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Think accurately.</strong> You must learn to make two important distinctions to become an accurate thinker...</p>
                <p>Separate facts from opinions, hearsay, unproved hypotheses, etc.</p>
                <p>Separate important facts from unimportant facts.</p>
                <p>Your success in the information age depends on your ability to screen out distractions and false leads.</p>
                <p>Strategy: Use the following questions to test any significant new piece of information you encounter... and to re-examine long-held beliefs that may affect your perception of new ideas:</p>
                <p>Is the source of information an authority on the subject being discussed?</p>
                <p>Could he/she have a motive other than simply imparting accurate information?</p>
                <p>Is it possible to verify his statements with reference books or other resources?</p>
                <p>Any statement that for some reason does not seem reasonable to you should be examined further before you simply accept or reject it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Inspire teamwork.</strong> You can create a team by generating in others that enthusiasm to work toward your goal or objective.</p>
                <p>Your positive mental attitude is the determining factor in your ability to communicate your desires in such a way that friends or colleagues sign on willingly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Learn from adversity-and learn from defeat.</strong> No one wins all the time. But the person who will eventually succeed is the one who uses a defeat or setback as an opportunity to reexamine his plan... to correct the flaws or bad habits revealed through that failure... and to move forward with a revised, improved plan.</p>
                <p>Every defeat carries the seed of an equivalent benefit. Before you can realize that benefit, you must overcome the natural tendency to be hinderd by the fear of trying again or to accept a defeat as final.</p>
                <p>Only when we are severely tested do we develop the strength of character to sustain us when we face the adversities that inevitably come in life.</p>
                <p>Every setback or temporary failure you experience is simply one that you've eliminated on your way toward ultimately succeeding. Seldom is anything worthwhile achieved on the first attempt or with little or no difficulty.</p>

        <h2>Carl May's Strategy for Winning</h2>
        
        <h3>And winning... and winning</h3>
        <p>It doesn't take genius or superhuman ability to win in your career... in sports... and in all areas of your life. What it does take is the ability to maximize what you already have in order to overcome everyday obstacles.</p>
        <p>You must be able to keep the temporary setbacks we all experience from turning into defeats.</p>
        <p>I have collected the winning strategies of great sports figures, coaches, business leaders and entertainers and distilled them - and the lessons of my own life and career - into principles that can help anyone succeed.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Accept yourself and your worth.</strong> You must know yourself - and accept yourself for what you are before you can become a winner.</p>
                <p>Important: Don't be overly critical of yourself. The more you compare yourself and your performance with those of others who you think are more proficient, the easier it is to overlook the important things that you do well.</p>
                <p>Strategy: Draw a line down a sheet of paper. List your weaknesses on one side... and your strengths on the other. Concentrate on using your strengths more effectively... then on improving your weaknesses - if necessary.</p>
                <p>Accepting yourself and recognizing your worth is the beginning of true success. The better you know yourself, the better you'll do at setting... planning... and reaching goals that will make you a winner.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Develop and maintain a positive attitude.</strong> We all have our share of problems and troubles. Adversity can defeat you if you let it. If you always look for failure, you are bound to fail.</p>
                <p>Key: Work at being an optimist. Always look for ways to overcome your obstacles. Refuse to accept excuses for failing. No one is suggesting that you close your eyes to the problems and obstacles that confront you. But if you approach every situation expecting to succeed, you will succeed. If you believe you are going to fail, however, your subconscious mind will help you fail.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Be creative.</strong> Having a positive attitude will help you win... but you need more. You must also be creative.</p>
                <p>True creativity is doing a common thing uncommonly well.</p>
                <p>Strategy: Pick something that's considered important by people in your industry and become great at it. Maybe it's writing sales letters - or dealing with customers on the phone. Consider your interests, talents and abilities. The possibilities for doing key things uncommonly well are substantial.</p>
                <p>Too many people refuse to accept that they have the ability to be creative... to be uncommonly good at something. They wish for abilities they don't have.</p>
                <p>Important: We're all born with enormous creative potential. All we have to do is work at making the most of that potential.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Don't fear failure.</strong> Everything new involves the risk of failure. But what would your life be if your fear of failure took complete control of your actions? You would never develop relationships or seize professional opportunities. You would never ask for a raise... bid on a house... or even offer a suggestion to someone else.</p>
                <p>It's hard to suffer a setback. And, of course, failure is worse. But there's a big difference between short-term failure and total defeat.</p>
                <p>Some people believe that if at first they don't succeed, the goal wasn't meant to be achieved. That's not how winners think. When winners get knocked down, they get back up and try again until they succeed - if not in one way, then in another...if not at one thing, then at another.</p>
                <p>A temporary failure doesn't have to lead to total defeat. All successful people have experience failure, learned from it and grown stronger.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Live by positive values.</strong> It takes courage and character to win. Yet these days, the headlines are filled with stories of unethical behavior athlete's wrong-doings...insider-trading schemes on Wall Street...political shenanigans.</p>
                <p>To succeed over the long term, you must know what is right and wrong, and you must use these standards of behavior every day in both your business and personal lives. Adhering to a strong code of positive values will make your life productive, fulfilling and profitable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Set goals.</strong> If you don't know where you're going, you risk winding up somewhere you don't want to be. If you plan your days, weeks, months and years, things will fall into place. Instead of just taking things as they come, you will cause events to happen.</p>
                <p>Strategy: Ask yourself - What do I have, and what can I do with what I have in order to reach where I want to go?</p>
                <p>Make the goals specific. Put them in writing so you remember exactly what you want to do. Once you've written down a goal, look at it several times a day.</p>
                <p>Trap: Don't set your goals so high that they can never be reached. That will only result in frustration. But don't set them so low that they can be reached too easily.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Visualize your way to success.</strong> Visualizing is seeing things happen before they actually happen...then doing what needs to be done to make them happen. Set your goals... make your plans...then visualize your success.</p>
                <p>When you visualize, you form vivid pictures in your conscious mind. Those pictures of your goals or objectives are kept alive until they sink into your subconscious mind, untapped energies are released to help visualized pictures become reality.</p>
                <p>Strategy: Make mental pictures of what you want to accomplish. If you think you deserve more responsibility, visualize yourself asking your boss for it and explaining why you should get it. The more you visualize, the more confidence you will develop to ask for what you want. The back of my business card reads, Those who can see the invisible can do the impossible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Work hard at working with others.</strong> I've seen so many corporations and sports teams fail to become winning teams because their talented players couldn't work - or win - together.</p>
                <p>You become a winner by practicing cooperation. Cooperation is not so much learning how to get along with others as it is smoothing out your rough edges so that others can get along with you.</p>
                <p>Strategy: Take a hard look at your associates. Identify their strengths, and praise them for what they do best. That will help them think more positively about themselves. It will also cause them to respond more positively to you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Do it now.</strong> Don't procrastinate. Don't let a busy schedule keep you from doing what has to be done. The sooner you attack any problem, the more energy and creativity you bring to solving it and the more likely that you'll solve it well.</p>
                <p>The longer a problems hangs around, the more likely it is to become larger than life. When old problems loom, you're likely to do a job any way you can to get it done rather than give it your best shot. Doing a job any old way is no way to become a winner.</p>
            </li>
