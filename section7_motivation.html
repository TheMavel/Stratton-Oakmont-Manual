        <h2>The Anatomy of Success: Developing the Right Habits</h2>
        
        <p>HUMAN BEINGS ARE ALL CREATURES OF HABIT: BOTH GOOD AND BAD. ONCE WE GET IN A "GROOVE" ITS HARD TO CHANGE TRACKS. THIS CAN WORK EITHER FOR OR AGAINST US. THE FOLLOWING ARE COMMON HABITS AND TRAITS OF MOST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. GET IN THE "GROOVE" OF SUCCESS BY REPEATING AND FOLLOWING THESE AFFIRMATIONS:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>I HAVE CLEARLY DEFINED GOALS AND IDENTIFY THE STEPS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS.</li>
            <li>I HAVE A WELL THOUGHT OUT "BATTLE PLAN" IN ACHIEVING MY GOALS WHICH I PURSUE WITH RELENTLESS PERSISTENCE, SELF-SACRIFICE AND DISCIPLINE.</li>
            <li>I BELIEVE IN MYSELF AND MY DESTINY WITH SUCCESS.</li>
            <li>I HAVE AN INTENSE DESIRE FOR SUCCESS WHICH CREATES AN ENERGY FORCE WHICH ENABLES ME TO PAY THE PRICE OF SELF SACRIFICE, HARD WORK, PERSISTENCE AND SELF DISCIPLINE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE MY GOALS.</li>
            <li>I PICTURE IN MY MINDS EYE, THE REWARDS OF SUCCESS WHICH SERVES AS "FUEL" TO KEEP MY ENGINE BURNING.</li>
            <li>I KNOW I'M DESTINED FOR SUCCESS. EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN MY LIFE IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING MY SUCCESS. I VIEW SETBACKS AS LEARNING EXPERIENCES WHICH INVARIABLY WILL OFFER SEEDS OF OPPORTUNITY. PROBLEMS ARE NEVER PROBLEMS BUT CHALLENGES THAT WITH CAREFUL THOUGHT AND ACTION ARE OVERCOME.</li>
            <li>I KNOW THAT ANGER, JEALOUSLY VINDICTIVENESS AND NEGATIVE THOUGHTS ARE TO BE AVOIDED LIKE A PLAQUE. THEY ARE VIRUSES WHICH INFECT A PERSONS MIND, DESTROYING THE WILL TO SUCCEED. I KNOW NOTHING CAN GET ME MAD UNLESS I ALLOW IT.</li>
            <li>I FEEL TERRIFIC.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>GET INTO THE HABIT OF SAYING AND DOING THE THINGS SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE DO AND YOU WILL CREATE AN ATTRACTION FORCE THAT WILL ENABLE YOU TO BE YOUR OWN MAGIC GENIE, WITH NOT THREE, BUT AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF WISHES YOU CAN GRANT FOR YOURSELF. JUST REPEAT DAILY THESE POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS AND PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH: YOUR WISHES WILL BE YOUR OWN COMMAND!</p>

        <h2>Mind Power</h2>
        
        <p class="author">BY: IRA BOSHNACK<br>MANAGING DIRECTOR</p>
        
        <p>"ANYTHING WITHIN REASON THAT THE MIND OF MAN CAN CONCEIVE AND BELIEVE CAN BE ACHIEVED."</p>
        
        <p>MENTAL OBSESSIONS HAVE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATIONS: YOUR BODY REACTS TO THE THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS OF THE MIND. YOUR THOUGHTS CAN MAKE YOU SICK OR RELEASE ENDORPHINS (OVER 50 TIMES MORE POTENT THAN MORPHINE) WHICH CAUSES ELATION AND GOOD HEALTH. AN EMOTIONALLY UPSET INDIVIDUAL IS MORE PRONE TO ACCIDENTS AND ILL HEALTH THAN AN EMOTIONALLY STABLE INDIVIDUAL.</p>
        
        <p>HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE WE WON'T BECOME VICTIMS OF OUR ANXIETIES? SINCE THE MIND TELLS THE BODY HOW TO ACT, THINK THE HIGHEST, MOST UPLIFTING THOUGHTS YOU CAN IMAGINE. HERE ARE SOME TIPS TO HELP YOU USE THE POWER OF YOUR MIND:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>VISUALIZE POSITIVE SITUATIONS.</li>
            <li>THINK AND SPEAK WELL OF YOUR HEALTH.</li>
            <li>USE YOUR POWER OF VISUALIZATION.</li>
            <li>USE POSITIVE SELF-TALK ON A DAILY BASIS.</li>
            <li>DON'T DWELL ON AILMENTS OR THEY WILL MAKE A HABIT OF RECURRING.</li>
            <li>DO SOME TYPE OF EXERCISE, ANYTHING WHICH PROMOTES CARDIOVASCULAR ACTIVITY.</li>
            <li>REGULAR EXERCISE CAN ADD TEN YEARS OF HEALTHY LIVING TO A PERSON'S LIFE.</li>
            <li>SET GOALS AND USE ENTHUSIASM TO REACH THEM.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>PERSISTENCE AND DETERMINATION TOGETHER ARE OMNIPOTENT. YOU NEVER FAIL UNLESS YOU QUIT. SUCCESSFUL INDIVIDUALS HAVE CLEARLY DEFINED GAME PLANS WHICH THEY REVIEW CONSTANTLY. THEY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE GOING EVERY DAY, EVERY MONTH AND EVERY YEAR. THINGS JUST DON'T HAPPEN IN THEIR LIVES: THEY MAKE THEM HAPPEN. DON'T LET ANYTHING STAND IN YOUR WAY. YOUR LEVEL OF PERSISTENCE IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY AND DISAPPOINTMENT WILL BE A MEASURE OF BELIEF IN YOURSELF. ASSOCIATE WITH PEOPLE WHO SHARE YOUR GOALS AND WORK HABITS. YOU MUST FOLLOW THE LEADERS, WHO ARE THE BEST AT WHAT THEY DO.</p>
        
        <p>PROBABLY THE HARDEST THING IS GETTING STARTED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. STARTING A SALES CAREER IS LIKE FLYING A PLANE. TO GET OFF THE GROUND YOU MUST HAVE FULL THROTTLE. BUT, YOU CAN'T KEEP IT AT THAT SPEED OR THE ENGINE WILL BURN OUT. WHEN THE PLANE REACHES CRUISING ALTITUDE, YOU PULL BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE THROTTLE. THIS IS THE WAY OUR SALES CAREERS ARE. TO A CERTAIN POINT, YOU HAVE TO PUT ON FULL THROTTLE TO TAKE OFF AND GET TO THE HEIGHTS WHERE YOU CAN THEN CRUISE.</p>
        
        <p>ONCE YOU HAVE ACHIEVED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SUCCESS, YOU CAN REWARD YOURSELF WITH MORE TIME FOR YOUR ENJOYMENT.</p>

        <h2>An Insight Into Becoming a Better Sales Professional</h2>
        
        <p class="author">BY: IRA BOSHNACK<br>MANAGING DIRECTOR</p>
        
        <p>"WE BECOME WHAT WE THINK ABOUT MOST"</p>
        
        <p>SALES PROFESSIONALS HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT. THEY PROMOTE OUR CAPITALISTIC DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. WITHOUT SALESPEOPLE, IBM, XEROX, MERRILL LYNCH, OR ANY MAJOR COMPANY COULD NEVER HAVE BECOME A FINANCIAL SUCCESS. THE PROFESSIONAL SALESPERSON IS THE HIGHEST PAID SEGMENT OF OUR SOCIETY.</p>
        
        <p>I HAVE NEVER MET A BORN SALES PROFESSIONAL, NO MATTER HOW GOOD HE OR SHE MAY BE. EVERY SUPER SALESPERSON IS A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL. THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE OF SUCCESS. THEY HAVE MADE THE COMMITMENT TO PRACTICE, DRILL, AND REHEARSE THE KEY INGREDIENTS OF SUCCESS IN THEIR FIELD. NO ONE HAS EVERG BEEN DENIED THE RIGHT TO WEALTH AND SUCCESS BY ANYONE BUT THEMSELVES. WHAT YOU FACE IS AN ENORMOUS NEED FOR A THING CALLED EFFORT. PROFESSIONAL EFFORT, STUDY AND APPLICATION. YOU ARE EARNING TODAY EXACTLY WHAT YOUR SKILL, EFFORT AND WILL POWER HAVE ALLOWED YOU TO EARN.</p>
        
        <p>EVERYONE DEEP DOWN INSIDE HAS A VAST RESERVOIR OF TALENT AND ENERGY THAT CAN BE TAPPED AND DIRECTED TOWARDS ACHIEVING SUPER SUCCESS. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HAVE A BURNING DESIRE AND WILLINGNESS TO PAY THE PRICE OF SELF-DISCIPLINE, HARD WORK AND PERSISTENCE IN ACHIEVING YOUR SALES GOALS.</p>
        
        <p>ONE OF THE SECRETS TO SUCCESSFUL SALES IS POSITIVE THINKING AND THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE MENTAL VISUAL IMAGERY. OUR BEHAVIOR IS GOVERNED BY IMAGES OF ACHIEVEMENT AND WITHOUT THESE IMAGES WE CANNOT MOBILIZE AND MOTIVATE OURSELVES TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS. THE POWER OF MENTAL VISUALIZATION CAN HARNESS A FLOOD OF SENSORY VISUAL IMAGES TO REINFORCE AN INTELLECTUALLY FORMULATED PLAN THAT WILL RELEASE AN UNLIMITED SOURCE OF ENTHUSIASM TO APPLY TOWARDS INCREASED SALES. WHEN YOUR IMAGINATION IS HARNESSED AND FOCUSED ON THE BENEFITS AND REWARDS OF SUCCESS, THE FIRES OF MOTIVATION ARE LIT ALONG WITH THE SELF-DISCIPLINE AND SACRIFICE TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS. THE POWER OF MENTAL VISUALIZATION SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED.</p>
        
        <p>THE POWER OF THE MIND AND VISUAL IMAGERY CAN BE FURTHER UNDERSTOOD BY SIMPLY THINKING HOW WHEN WE ARE HUNGRY AND THINK ABOUT OUR FAVORITE FOOD, OUR MOUTHS BEGIN TO WATER OR WHEN WE HEAR FANTASTIC NEWS A RUSH OF GOOD FEELINGS ENVELOPES US; OR WHEN WE HEAR HORRIBLE NEWS, WE FEEL A GUT RIPPING SENSATION IN THE PIT OF OUR STOMACHS. REMEMBER THAT EVERY GREAT WORK AND DISCOVERY FIRST EXISTED IN SOMEONE'S MIND AS A VIVID IMAGE. EVERY ACT AND DEED THAT HAS ENABLED MANKIND TO EXCEL AND ACHIEVE SUCCESS WAS FIRST BORN IN SOMEONE' MIND. MAKE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, INTENSE POSITIVE THINKING AND VISUAL IMAGERY CAN CHANGE ALL OF YOUR LIVES. THE ABILITY TO TRANSLATE ONE'S HOPE AND ASPIRATIONS INTO POSITIVE SENSORY-RICH IMAGES IS THE CUTTING EDGE WHICH SEPARATES THE HIGH ACHIEVER FROM THE RUN OF THE MILL EVERYDAY PERSON. THE SUSTAINED INTENSITY OF YOUR POSITIVE THOUGHTS AND DETAILED MENTAL VISUALIZATION WILL BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR IN THE DEGREE OF YOUR SUCCESS IN SALES AS WELL AS IN LIFE!</p>
