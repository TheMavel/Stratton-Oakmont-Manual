        <h2>The Power of Hunger</h2>
        
        <h3>You Gotta Be Hungry! Live Up to Your Greatness</h3>
        <p>YOU CAN TELL BY SOMEONE'S lifestyle if he's hungry. He works longer and harder. He researches accounts. He knows the product, the industry, and the competition.</p>
        <p>When I was a sales rep at a radio station in Florida, I had a really egotistical manager. He enjoyed handing out our paychecks each month and sneering, "Here's what you're worth." If you had a small commission check, you dropped your head. But I saw this guy as a challenge. You can become bitter or better, and I became determined to sell circles around him. One month, I sold four times his salary.</p>
        <p>Life can seem so negative. But I believe that every time you get knocked on your back, you need to remember: If you can look up, you can get up! Get up to prove people wrong. Get up because you're hungry to make something of your life. You've got to develop yourself and believe in your worth. When your sense of self grows so does your paycheck. Personal growth involves four stages:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Self-assessment.</strong> Know who you are and what you want out of life. Figure out what resources you need to make it happen. Let's say your goal is to double your sales. Look at what it took to produce what you're selling now. How many calls did you make? How did you manage your time?</p>
                <p>Get some caring feedback. People won't tell you when your breath stinks. You've got to ask your friends and coworkers for the truth. We all have some blind spots. Find out about yours.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Self-approval.</strong> Most people don't reach their full potential. Why? It has to do with what they feel they deserve. If a kid who believes he is an "A" student gets a B, hell work like crazy until he gets and A. But if a B student gets an A, he's likely to think he was just lucky. We live up to our own expectations.</p>
                <p>Increase your sense of self-approval by getting training or personal coaching. Stay focused. Peter Drucker says, "This is the era of accelerated change." You've got to make changes constantly to stay on the competitive edge.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Self-commitment.</strong> When you feel that you're worthy of greatness, you'll do whatever is required to make it happen. I know a car salesman who would stay on the phone more than anyone. He would make 75 to 100 cold calls a day. He was undaunted by the people who rudely hung up. And when he got customers, he made it his business to go beyond the call of duty. He didn't just satisfy them, he amazed them. Today, he owns three car dealerships.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Self-fulfillment.</strong> When you reach a goal, congratulate yourself. As a friend of mine says, you've got to acknowledge "I done good."</p>
                <p>But you can't rest too long. Raise the stakes. Albert Einstein said, "The thinking that has brought me this far has created some problems that this thinking can't solve." You've got to repeat these four steps every time you reach a new point.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Growth Through Adversity</h2>
        
        <p>When you're chasing your dreams, you'll encounter plenty of problems. Don't beat yourself up. Going through adversity means you'll never be the same again. You'll be better!</p>
        <p>You can't control everything. When I went into TV, my objective was to create a show to solve real life problems. My show got high ratings, but it was canceled because I wouldn't do stories about fathers who slept with their daughters' boyfriends. I was disappointed. I was hurt. But I didn't die. Experience the pain. Embrace the struggle. It's not just about reaching goals, it's about the kind of person you become in the process.</p>
        <p>Reflect on and review your life to see how well things are going. You've heard about the lumberjack who was too busy chopping wood to stop and sharpen his ax. Going all out to achieve professional success doesn't mean you have to ignore personal growth. You've got to take care of yourself to remain productive. And, taking some time to enjoy yourself will help you meet new challenges with an alert mind.</p>
        <p>The important difference between me now and me 10 years ago isn't dollars - it's my own self-worth. There's an African proverb that says, "If there's no enemy within, the enemy outside can do us no harm." They key to excellence in sales? That's easy. Get hungry and focus on improving yourself.</p>
