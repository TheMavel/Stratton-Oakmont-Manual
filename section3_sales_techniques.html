        <h3>Don'ts</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Pick up bad habits.</strong> You first make your habits, then your habits make you. This is the most important philosophy for you to understand. You don't suddenly have a bad habit; for example, you don't become an alcoholic or a drug addict. You make one mistake, then another and another and this creates a habit. Once it is almost impossible to break. Think about it, we are all creatures of habit. We wake up at the same time, we eat the same things, we go to the same hangouts and say the same things over and over. Don't let destructive behavior become a habit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Never ever be discourteous to a prospect or their secretary.</strong> How foolish could one be? You told them your name and the firm which you represent - This will certainly come back to haunt you, the broker and the firm you work for. Save yourself the heartache and embarrassment by keeping your composure. Be polite, apologetic, respectful and professional.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Don't waste time,</strong> there are only so many hours in a day, and so many minutes in an hour. Every minute counts - every single minute. You spend most of your day trying to make contact, you've got to get the dials in.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Never comment on or after each phone call or lead.</strong> Everyone has a story to tell, either this or that, nobody wants to hear it! Nobody! Just get your leads and do your job, that's it. Who cares how your conversation with Mr. Jones was? Good or bad, who cares?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Don't ever waste your time talking and screwing around with other brokers or trainees.</strong> At the end of each day you are judged on your performance, and so is the fool next to you who lets you distract him. You are all on a mission, to be a great cold caller, pass your test and be a successful stockbroker. Any other activity beyond your mission is a waste of time (see #3 on Wasting Time or #1 on Bad Habits for a more detailed explanation).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Don't make non-productive phone calls</strong> either to friends outside or brokers inside the firm. The phones in the boardroom are for business - period.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Never drift into space while cold calling.</strong> Stay focused and pumped. Keep your blood pumping by standing and moving around.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Why:</h4>
        <p>(a) If he's up + you're down = no conversation<br>
        (b) If he's down + you're down = no conversation<br>
        (c) If he's down + you're up = no conversation<br>
        (d) If he's up + you're up = conversation is up</p>
