        <h3>Expanded Do's</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Be an example of what a broker trainee should be.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Separate yourself from the crowd.</strong> Eagles don't flock, you find them one at a time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Always be polite and professional.</strong> Each contact you make is a representation of the firm image.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Try to keep motivated and energetic throughout the day.</strong> This will build endurance and most important foundation for your success. This business is not a sprint but a marathon, don't ever forget that.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Make the most of your day, keep focused and keep your eyes on your goals...</strong>daily, weekly, monthly etc....</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Play by the numbers, it is proven, stick to it.</strong> Speak to 50 people a day or 5/6 an hour. This is a profession, the more people you contact, the better you will actually do!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Thank every prospect</strong> (good, bad or indifferent) for their time. It helps keep you out of trouble and people will understand you're only doing your job, trying to make a living.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Never ever think or believe that you are just a cold caller,</strong> no matter what I say or anyone else. You are an apprentice of a stockbroker who is learning a career. Simply put, a broker trainee.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Be prepared to live for your first two years like no one else.</strong> Working harder than you ever thought possible and for the rest of your life you will live like no one can.</p>

    <section id="what-is-a-qualified-investor" class="section">
        <h2>What is a Qualified Investor?</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Any corporation or individual investor with $100K annual income and book net worth or more in the stock market.</li>
            <li>Any investor with $100K or more in the stock market who is somewhat receptive. I say somewhat because they don't have to be overjoyed that they heard from you.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>For a Better Qualified Lead, The Following Information Would Benefit Both the Broker and the Prospect:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Big Board, OTC or International Investments</li>
            <li>Aggressive or conservative</li>
            <li>More long term or short term</li>
            <li>Ballpark number/amount in the market</li>
            <li>Comfort level on an idea</li>
            <li>Area of interest (eg: drugs, auto, retail, biotech, etc....)</li>
            <li>Most recent investment</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Correct Qualification</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest mistakes the novice broker will make is a "weak" qualification. "Weak" qualifications represent major road blocks on your road to success because they rarely wind up as clients and in the process diminish your confidence level as a closer.</p>
        
        <p>You must understand that your time is your most valuable asset. As crude as it may sound, you don't have time for information seekers and individuals not interested or in the position to open whatever type of account you are presenting. You only have so much time to work with a certain amount of people: Time is money so spend it wisely!</p>
        
        <p>"Weak" qualifications will lead to what I call a "sales inferiority complex". The prospect rarely takes your calls and sounds like he is doing you a favor by just talking to you.</p>
        
        <p>When a prospect gives you the rush act, and says just send the literature, you can be relatively sure that invariably it will be a "weak" qualification. The literature you send will probably wind up in the prospect's "circular file", commonly known as a waste paper basket.</p>
        
        <p>In my opinion, the only correct qualification is the one who you believe is an excellent prospect to become your client and meets the following ingredients:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Suitable For Speculation</strong> - Prospect is prepared to take a calculated risk for the possiblity of substantial profit.</li>
            <li><strong>Open-Minded and Willing to Invest</strong> - Prospect is a serious investor and has an open mind toward what you are presenting where he is willing and in a position to invest if he likes what he sees.</li>
            <li><strong>In a Liquid Position to Invest</strong> - Prospect has a specified amount of liquid risk capital now or can liquidate stocks or other liquid assets within 30 days to get that amount if he wants to invest.</li>
            <li><strong>Will Read Literature</strong> - Prospect promises to read what you will send and give the professional courtesy of reviewing it with you.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>It's a lot better to find out the prospect is not interested or suitable right away than chasing after him and wasting your time for several weeks. If you caught the prospect at a bad time and can't confirm the prior four points, requalify later or the next day.</p>
        
        <p>If you have a good supply of leads, especially with the current increased public interest in stocks after making 20 to 30 contacts in a day you should average 8 to 10 strong qualifications. (If you are getting much more than that you probably aren't qualifying right or you are using very expensive fresh advertised leads). Forty to fifty strong qualifications a week should represent at least 5 to 8 deals weekly and the foundation of building a successful business.</p>
        
        <p>Don't forget: Time is money. You wouldn't think of wasting your money so don't ever time. The road to riches starts with the correct qualification!</p>

    <section id="qualifying-for-money" class="section">
        <h2>Qualifying for Money</h2>
        
        <p>Experienced stock brokers will tell you, there is virtually no difference in the effort expended in closing an account for $5,000 or $50,000 account and the client will have a better opportunity to be successful.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately when it comes to qualifying for money many brokers go about it the wrong way. The usual qualification by most amateur brokers is, "how much risk capital do you have for speculation". When asked in this matter most prospect will ask, "what is the minimum" or give you a number much lower than they are capable of investing.</p>
        
        <p>I recommend considering the following qualification as a guide whenever qualifying for money:</p>
        
        <p>Mr. Prospect if after you receive the information, me answering your questions and concerns, your feeling comfortable with me and my firm and you decided to invest, could you comfortably handle $100,000 in liquid risk capital within the next few weeks?</p>
        
        <p>If the prospect indicates $100,000 is too much money, you might say:<br>
        My greatest concern is not how much you invest but to start a business relationship with you. How much risk capital do you have available now if you liked what you saw and decided to invest?</p>
        
        <p>By taking this approach you will qualify for much larger amounts of money. When you are concentrating on a portfolio of 100,50 or even 25 thousand dollars and the prospect is nervous or apprehensive to open an account, as last resort, "drop closing" to a lesser amount, many times it will enable the prospect to feel comfortable enough to become your client. It's always easier going down than up.</p>
        
        <p>Remember, if the investor is in the financial position, its no more difficult closing a $160,000 than a $10,000 account.</p>
        
        <p>Qualify for large size accounts, always thinking and talking about large size accounts and your thoughts and hard work will form an attraction force bringing them to you.</p>

    <section id="handling-special-cases" class="section">
        <h2>Special Handling Situations</h2>
        
        <h3>Prospect You're Calling is Hostile</h3>
        <p>First: Apologize for the inconvenience, with the promise to take them off your list. Politely hang up.</p>
        <p>Second: Save the card with a Big H across and each month I will collect them to delete from our file.</p>
        
        <h3>Disconnects</h3>
        <p>Do the same as above. Save the card for deletion from our list with a D written across it.</p>
        
        <h3>When a Prospect Says He is Happy with His Broker</h3>
        <p>If he implies that he's is in the market and he hangs up -- SAVE THE LEAD! Today may not be your day, but you will have others. Write on the card (O/B), which means OTHER BROKER and hold onto it!</p>
